## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Your Codespace is YOUR Workspace
- It's **private** - only you can see it
- Changes you make **don't affect** the main repository
- You can experiment, break things, and learn safely!
- Reuse the same Codespace all semester (don't create multiples!)

### Getting Fresh Code
If you mess something up and want the original:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### Codespace Limits
- **Free tier:** 60 hours/month (about 2 hours per class day)
- **Stop your Codespace** when done to save hours
- **Delete old Codespaces** you're not using

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Running Code Issues
- Check you're in the right directory (`pwd` to see where you are)
- Make sure file names match exactly (Java is case-sensitive!)
- Compile before running (`javac` then `java`)

### Codespace Issues
- If it's slow, close unused tabs
- If it won't start, delete old Codespaces from your GitHub account
- Out of hours? Use local install or wait for monthly reset

### General Questions
- Check the lecture README files first
- Ask in class or office hours
- Post on discussion board (no code solutions please!)
